# Antani Token Goal
ANTANI Token aims to become the very first Ethical Token for Supercazzola Prematurata, celebraing the Antani Heritage in a Web3 way.

ANTANI is meant celebrate [Amici Miei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Friends_(film)), following tech-community effort in developing [Monicelli](https://github.com/esseks/monicelli) language.

Amici Miei, with it's Supercazzola Prematurata lead the Innovation in the '70s with Entropy, so ANTANI Token must follow the same.

# Token Technical Implementation
ANTANI is a Smart Contract, designed for ERC20 compatible blockchains where it will be deployed: Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Arbitrium

# Tokenomics Design
The unique innovation of ANTANI is to become the first INUTILITY TOKEN, it means a Token that can't be used for any speculative purposes.

ANTANI isn't a Meme Token, like DOGE or SHIBA INU, whereby the market dynamics enable price spike-up and spike-down, because it's designed with entropy in mind.

The tokenomics principles are the following:
- ANTANI must Increase the Entropy of it's Token Holding
- There must be a Incentive to Mint Antani TOKEN by increasing the Entropy of Token Holding
- There must be a Disincentive to Redeem Antani TOKEN for speculative purposes (The values of redemption must follow the Entropy rules)
- The "value" of an ATANI Token can't be easily determined, due to the entropic nature of Redemption/Minting process (no backend token-holding-value is possible)

In order to Mint an ANTANI Tokens, the originating wallet must send some tokens to the ANTANI Smart Contract.

The amount of Tokens received, depends on the Entropy increase in the Token Holding diversification that the transaction triggered, without any relationship to the underlying "economic value" of the tokens being sent.

For instance, at T0 with ANTANI Smart Contract holding 0 Tokens, sending 1 SHIBA INU or 1 BTC, would mint giving back the very same amount of ANTANI Tokens, because there are 0 SHIBA INU and 0 BTC being holded by the contract in the internal token holding % distribution.

The goal if that ANTANI Smart Contract must growth with by holding the greater diversity and entropy of Tokens, increasing Token Entropy.

The Redeemption process of the ANTANI Token,  accordingly to the Entropy design, will gives back a diversified and proportionate amount of Tokens in order to increase balance the Entropy of the Token Holding.

The resulting goal is that the ANTANI Token, hold and gives back a lot of nicely looking icons, in the will to represent the INUTILITY Token design principles.

With the approach above, there's the risk of an attack based on the fact that anyone on any blockchain can create a Token, thus Minting Antani with a lot of non-existing Tokens created from scratch. This attack would hamper the INUTILITY goal of having a lot of nicely looking icons of the existing Tokens, led by the Entropy principle. In order to avercome that attack, ANTANI must be able to Mint tokens only when receiving Tokens among the first X (es: 300) by exchange volumes on the specific Blockchain where it's residing. This feature could be accomplished by the uses of Data Oracles, filtering inbound tokens to Mint functions dynamically, or by assigning at ERC20 creation time a static list of Tokens that on that Blockchain feature a nicely looking icons (the list length maybe different depending on Blockchain).

The final outcome of this design is made up so that, by Redeeming an ANTANI, isn't possible to know which kind of Tokens and in which amount will be sent back, the facto making a very dirty wallet, providing an incentive to become ANTANI HODLer.


# Community
The ANTANI Community works in complete Decentralized way on Telegram https://t.me/antanitoken .

By the development of ANTANI DeFi ecosystem, the community is giving the governance to the ANTANI DAO, whereby the Token itself represent the Governance rules.
